This is the repository for Stellar's `stellard`, reference P2P server.

###Build instructions:

### Vagrant (your very own testnet)

1.  Install vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/)
2.  run `vagrant up`
3.  There is no step 3.

You now have a running testnet accessible on ports 9001 (websocket) and 9002 (rpc).  It will not connect to other instances and will have it's own ledger set.
